## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby installed on your system (version 2.5 or higher recommended)
- A text editor or IDE
- Terminal/command line access

### Installation

Check if Ruby is installed:
```bash
ruby --version
```

If not installed, visit https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

### Running the Examples

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the desired directory:
   ```bash
   cd LearnRuby/01-fundamentals
   ```
3. Run any Ruby file:
   ```bash
   ruby filename.rb
   ```

Example:
```bash
cd LearnRuby/projects
ruby guessing_game.rb
```

### Recommended Learning Path

For the best learning experience, follow the order in **LEARNING_PATH.md**. This guide provides a structured progression through all concepts with detailed explanations for each file.

## Learning Path

This repository is organized into progressive modules. For a detailed step-by-step guide through all files, see **LEARNING_PATH.md**.

### Quick Overview

**Phase 1: Fundamentals** (01-fundamentals/)
Start here to learn basic syntax, variables, data types, strings, and user input.

**Phase 2: Data Structures** (03-data-structures/)
Learn to organize data with arrays and hashes.

**Phase 3: Control Flow** (02-control-flow/)
Master conditionals, loops, and program flow.

**Phase 4: Functions** (04-functions/)
Write reusable code with methods.

**Phase 5: Object-Oriented Programming** (05-oop/)
Understand classes, objects, and inheritance.

**Phase 6: Code Organization** (06-modules/)
Organize code across multiple files with modules.

**Phase 7: File Operations** (07-file-io/)
Read from and write to external files.

**Phase 8: Error Handling** (08-error-handling/)
Handle exceptions gracefully.

**Practice Projects** (projects/)
Apply your knowledge with complete applications that combine multiple concepts.

## Key Features

- Code organization across files
- `require_relative` usage
- Module inclusion
- Namespace management

### File Operations (07-file-io/)
Demonstrates:
- Reading files multiple ways
- Writing and appending to files
- File modes (read, write, append, read/write)
- Automatic file closing with blocks

## Code Style

This repository follows Ruby conventions:
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces
- **Comments**: Descriptive and educational
- **Naming**: snake_case for variables and methods
- **Section Headers**: ASCII separators for clarity
- **Multi-line Comments**: Using `=begin` and `=end` for longer explanations

## Common Ruby Methods Covered

**String Methods**: `.upcase`, `.downcase`, `.strip`, `.length`, `.include?`, `.index`, `.[]`

**Array Methods**: `.push`, `.pop`, `.shift`, `.unshift`, `.sort`, `.include?`, `.length`, `.[]`

**Hash Methods**: Key-value access, hash traversal

**File Methods**: `.open`, `.read`, `.readline`, `.readlines`, `.readchar`, `.write`, `.close`

**Math Operations**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `.abs`, `.round`, `.ceil`, `.floor`

## Learning Tips

1. **Read the comments first** - Understand what each section does before running it
2. **Modify the code** - Change values and see what happens
3. **Break things intentionally** - Learn from errors
4. **Type it out** - Don't just copy/paste; type the code to build muscle memory
5. **Experiment** - Try different approaches to the same problem
6. **Run frequently** - Test small changes as you go
7. **Follow LEARNING_PATH.md** - Use the structured guide for best results
